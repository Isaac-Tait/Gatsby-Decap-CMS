          Royal Ridges Retreat started in 1978 with a very generous gift of 78
          acres of land by Roy and Jean Andersen. We are located 25 miles
          northeast of Vancouver, Washington in the tranquil and scenic
          foothills of the majestic Cascade Mountain range. Our camp has use of
          390 acres of breathtaking hills, trails, pastures, and streams that
          wind their way to Andersen Lake.

          Our Mission and Affiliation

        <p>
          Royal Ridges Retreat is a Christian non-profit ministry. Our mission
          is to move one step closer to Christ by reaching the unsaved with the
          gospel of Jesus Christ through love and personal example. This is done
          through the following three points: fun, safe, God. Our goal is to
          provide a fun and safe experience for every camper who attends a Royal
          Ridges camp. We do this while also teaching important Biblical
          principles in the context of God's beautiful outdoors. Campers will
          learn new skills, meet new challenges, make life long friends, and
          learn about themselves in a positive, caring environment. All campers
          are welcomed at Royal Ridges without regard to race, color, or
          national origin. Our camp programs are tailored for youth grades 1 to
          12. Our adult programs and retreats are perfect for groups or
          organizations as well as individuals. We also offer a unique
          combination of parent-child programs. Although we are a part of the
          Pacific Northwest District of the Evangelical Free Church, all of our
          programs are intended to be non-denominational in design, scope and
          teaching. Thanks to revenues from operations and the generous gifts of
          individuals and churches who believe in our ministry, we are able to
          be self supporting.
