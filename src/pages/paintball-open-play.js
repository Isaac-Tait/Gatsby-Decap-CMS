                    <p>Royal Ridges loves to spread the love for paintball, and a unique way we get to drive the sport forward is to host open play days. This allows individuals or small groups of friends to come together with other like-minded people and spend the day playing some fun paintball games and scenarios here at our course. Pre-registration for the event so we know how many players will be playing. So come out and join us in a great outdoor sport to build camaraderie and stay fit and healthy. Fill out the open play pre-registration below.</p>
