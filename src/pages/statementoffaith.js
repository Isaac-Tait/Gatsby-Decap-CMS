          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">God</p>
          <p>
            We believe in one God, Creator of all things, holy, infinitely
            perfect, and eternally existing in a loving unity of three equally
            divine Persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Having
            limitless knowledge and sovereign power, God has graciously purposed
            from eternity to redeem a people for Himself and to make all things
            new for His own glory.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">The Bible</p>
          <p>
            We believe that God has spoken in the Scriptures, both Old and New
            Testaments, through the words of human authors. As the verbally
            inspired Word of God, the Bible is without error in the original
            writings, the complete revelation of His will for salvation, and the
            ultimate authority by which every realm of human knowledge and
            endeavor should be judged. Therefore, it is to be believed in all
            that it teaches, obeyed in all that it requires, and trusted in all
            that it promises.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">
            The Human Condition
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that God created Adam and Eve in His image, but they
            sinned when tempted by Satan. In union with Adam, human beings are
            sinners by nature and by choice, alienated from God, and under His
            wrath. Only through God’s saving work in Jesus Christ can we be
            rescued, reconciled and renewed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">Jesus Christ</p>
          <p>
            We believe that Jesus Christ is God incarnate, fully God and fully
            man, one Person in two natures. Jesus—Israel&#39;s promised
            Messiah—was conceived through the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin
            Mary. He lived a sinless life, was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
            arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven and sits at the
            right hand of God the Father as our High Priest and Advocate.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">
            The Work of Christ
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that Jesus Christ, as our representative and substitute,
            shed His blood on the cross as the perfect, all-sufficient sacrifice
            for our sins. His atoning death and victorious resurrection
            constitute the only ground for salvation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">The Holy Spirit</p>
          <p>
            We believe that the Holy Spirit, in all that He does, glorifies the
            Lord Jesus Christ. He convicts the world of its guilt. He
            regenerates sinners, and in Him they are baptized into union with
            Christ and adopted as heirs in the family of God. He also indwells,
            illuminates, guides, equips and empowers believers for Christ-like
            living and service.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">The Church</p>
          <p>
            We believe that the true church comprises all who have been
            justified by God&#39;s grace through faith alone in Christ alone.
            They are united by the Holy Spirit in the body of Christ, of which
            He is the Head. The true church is manifest in local churches, whose
            membership should be composed only of believers. The Lord Jesus
            mandated two ordinances, baptism and the Lord&#39;s Supper, which
            visibly and tangibly express the gospel. Though they are not the
            means of salvation, when celebrated by the church in genuine faith,
            these ordinances confirm and nourish the believer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">
            Christian Living
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that God&#39;s justifying grace must not be separated
            from His sanctifying power and purpose. God commands us to love Him
            supremely and others sacrificially, and to live out our faith with
            care for one another, compassion toward the poor and justice for the
            oppressed. With God&#39;s Word, the Spirit&#39;s power, and fervent
            prayer in Christ&#39;s name, we are to combat the spiritual forces
            of evil. In obedience to Christ&#39;s commission, we are to make
            disciples among all people, always bearing witness to the gospel in
            word and deed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">
            Christ&#39;s Return
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe in the personal, bodily and premillennial return of our
            Lord Jesus Christ. The coming of Christ, at a time known only to
            God, demands constant expectancy and, as our blessed hope, motivates
            the believer to godly living, sacrificial service and energetic
            mission.
          </p>
          <p className="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-base">
            Response and Eternal Destiny
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that God commands everyone everywhere to believe the
            gospel by turning to Him in repentance and receiving the Lord Jesus
            Christ. We believe that God will raise the dead bodily and judge the
            world, assigning the unbeliever to condemnation and eternal
            conscious punishment and the believer to eternal blessedness and joy
            with the Lord in the new heaven and the new earth, to the praise of
            His glorious grace. Amen.
