<p className="my-4"> This summer, we lost our hay barn and feed floor to an accidental fire. 
Although some things are underway, much still needs to be done to care for the horses this winter. With about half the cost to rebuild covered, we are in need of a good old-fashioned “Barn Raising”!!Come join us in celebrating all the good things God has done this year, and support us in what is needed to carry out His work for the future.  </p>
