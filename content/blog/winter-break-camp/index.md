**Join us this Christmas break for our Winter Day Camp as we create 5 days of fun-filled holiday-themed adventures for campers from Kindergarten through 6th grade. We are looking forward to filling camp with the joy of the season.  We also offer a break-out horse activity for those kiddos who love horses. We are offering limited bus service for the first time for our winter camps so let us do the driving. Space is limited. Click on the image above for more information and to register for camp.**
