**Join us this Christmas break for our Winter Day Camp as we create 5 days of fun-filled holiday-themed adventures for campers from Kindergarten through 6th grade. We are looking forward to filling camp with the joy of the season.  We also offer a break-out horse activity for those kiddos who love horses. Space is limited, so click on the link below for more information and to register for camp.**
