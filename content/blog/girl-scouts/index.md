<p className="my-4"> Help your Girl Scout troop work toward earning their horse riding badge by registering for our Girl Scouts Riding Badge Class. Your troop will learn some of the basics of horses through horse facts, horse safety, some basics of care, leading a horse, how to groom and saddle, and they will get a ride in the arena.</p>

The class is 3 hours and will fulfill most of the Girl Scout Riding Badge requirements for ages five and up (patch not included). The scouts will get 30 minutes of riding time with this class. Leaders and parents are welcome to ride with them. \*Please note that riding has a weight limit of 250 lbs.\*

The riding portion will be an arena ride only. If you would like to book a trail ride in addition to this class on the same date, there will be an additional fee per rider and an added hour to the class. Riders must be at least nine years of age to ride on a trail ride.

Minimum Group size for Badge Class or Trail Ride = 7.
