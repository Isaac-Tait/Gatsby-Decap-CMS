Royal Ridges will forever be impacted by the love and care that Sue Wanger put into this camp. Sue passed away last week after a long fight with cancer. She leaves behind a lasting legacy and her three children. Sue and Ron ran Royal Ridges from 1996 to 2018. When Sue retired from her role at camp in 2016, Ron would always joke that he had to hire five people to replace all the jobs she did. When Sue wasn’t working in the office booking campers and guests, she was found working in the kitchen cooking for our guest groups and summer campers. Sue was the type of servant we can all strive to be. She did what was required and would often take on the jobs that were necessary but not glamorous. Sue and Ron leave a legacy of servitude behind them, and through their care of Royal Ridges and their love of Jesus, there will be a lasting impact on thousands of lives. We are so grateful to have known and served alongside such wonderful people as Sue and Ron Wanger. 

Thank You,

From all the campers and staff, past, present, and future.
