<p className="my-4">Friday evening, we had a fire in our hay barn. By the time I arrived at the barn, it was fully engulfed. Unfortunately, one horse sustained burns in a paddock beside the barn. He is being treated at OSU at the Veterinarian Hospital. The whole building is a total loss. We appreciate all the thoughts and prayers, and offers of help they are much appreciated. Below you will find a link to our donation page that will go toward helping us recover and rebuild if you want to donate physical items that were lost in the fire, the list is below. We will update this page as often as we can as we move forward with the recovery process</p>

<p className="my-4">James 1: 2-4 - Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.  And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p>
