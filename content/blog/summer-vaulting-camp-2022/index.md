Due to the popularity of our horse programs this summer, we have added a week of Vaulting Camp in order to create another opportunity for our campers to spend time with our awesome horses. Campers will learn the finer points of vaulting from a professional trainer. They will learn on the vaulting barrel as well as on horseback. If you want more information on the program then email Chrisy at programs@royalridges.org or you can register [HERE](https://www.ultracamp.com/info/upcomingSessions.aspx?idCamp=1145&campCode=151&lnkCategory=Horse+Camp)
